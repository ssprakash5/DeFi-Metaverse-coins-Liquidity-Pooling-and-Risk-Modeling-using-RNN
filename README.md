## Metaverse coins
Metaverse tokens are virtual currencies facilitating transactions within blockchain-based metaverses. Enabled by blockchain technology, these tokens ensure near-instant and secure transactions, fostering a corruption-free virtual economy. Holders can access services, gain in-game abilities, and own unique virtual items. Unlike traditional games, metaverse tokens hold real-world value, being exchangeable for fiat currencies or utilized as NFTs for authenticating ownership of tangible assets. Examples include SAND in Sandbox for NFT-driven virtual worlds, MANA in Decentraland for purchasing digital real estate, and ENJ in Enjin for a vast NFT network in the gaming/app ecosystem.

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a comprehensive risk modeling and management system for decentralized finance (DeFi) liquidity pools, focusing on tokens within blockchain-based metaverses. Deep learning techniques will be employed to predict and manage liquidity risks, ensuring the stability and security of decentralized financial protocols. Trained with Metaverse Coins Historical Data (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaushiksuresh147/metaverse-cryptos-historical-data)

## Skills and Technologies Utilized

- Deep Learning (Recurrent Neural Networks)
- Python (PyTorch)
- Data Preprocessing and Analysis
- Data Visualization
- DeFi Protocols (e.g., Uniswap, SushiSwap)
- Smart Contract Auditing
- Blockchain Technology

## Project Objectives

### Data Collection and Preprocessing

- Gather historical data from DeFi platforms(198 Metaverse coins), including Open, High, Low, and Close with Volume to understand the Liquidity, token prices, user behaviors, and market conditions.
- Clean, preprocess, and normalize the data to make it suitable for modeling.

### Risk Prediction Model
- Utilize deep learning models such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)- Long short-term memory (LSTM)
- Develop an LSTM model to predict the movement of price-changing.
- Then calculate the ImpermanentLoss and Use the LSTM model to predict the Risk Score.
- With a Moving Average of risk score and the Risk_threshold identify the place to add and remove liquidity.

### Liquidity Pool Management

- Design an algorithmic liquidity pool management system that dynamically adjusts liquidity provision strategies based on risk predictions.
- Implement automated strategies for adding or removing liquidity to optimize returns and mitigate potential losses.

### Visualization and Reporting

- Create interactive data visualizations to monitor liquidity pool performance and risk metrics(Risk Score, Moving Average(MA-7),position to Add and RemoveLiqidity with Risk Threshold)
- This will Generate risk assessment reports for liquidity providers, enabling them to make informed decisions.

### Calculate Cumulative and New Liquidity

- After adding Liquidity, the cumulative return over the period and Calculate the new liquidity.

## Expected Outcomes

- A robust risk prediction model that accurately forecasts liquidity pool risks in various DeFi environments.
- An automated liquidity pool management system that optimizes returns and minimizes losses for liquidity providers.
- Data-driven insights into DeFi liquidity pool behavior and risks.

## Impact

- Will improve risk management for DeFi liquidity providers, potentially increasing participation and liquidity in decentralized finance.
- Enhanced security and reliability of DeFi protocols through smart contract auditing.
- Advancement in the understanding and application of data science and deep learning in the DeFi space.

This project demonstrates expertise in data science, machine learning, deep learning, and blockchain technology, contributing to the development of safer and more efficient DeFi ecosystems while addressing critical challenges in the sector.
